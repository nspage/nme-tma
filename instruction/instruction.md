### TON Web3 Community Platform

#### Project Overview

The NME Telegram Mini App is a responsive, blockchain-integrated web application accessible within Telegram, specifically built for the TON ecosystem. This app aims to facilitate community interactions through wallet connections, event management, and digital badge systems.

#### Core Features

### 1. Authentication
- TON Connect wallet integration
- User profiles linked to wallet addresses
- Secure sign-in/sign-out flow

### 2. Event Management
- Create and manage IRL meetups
- Event details storage 
- Attendee management
- Check-in system
- RSVP functionality
- Notifications for upcoming events and deadlines

### 3. Digital Badges System

#### Collection Contract
- One collection per event series
- Stores common metadata and minting logic
- Manages badge issuance permissions

```typescript
interface CollectionMetadata {
    name: string;           // e.g., "TON Developer Meetups 2024"
    description: string;    // Collection description
    image: string;         // Collection logo/image
    social_links: string[]; // Community links
}
```

#### Badge Implementation (NFT/SBT)
- Individual badges for each event
- Non-transferable (SBT) for participation proof
- Metadata stored on TON Storage

```typescript
interface BadgeMetadata {
    name: string;          // e.g., "TON Meetup #1 - Attendee"
    description: string;   // Event description
    image: string;        // Badge artwork
    attributes: {
        event_date: string;
        location: string;
        role: string;      // "Attendee", "Speaker", "Organizer"
        achievement?: string;
    }
}
```

### 4. Check-in & Minting Flow

#### Pre-Event Setup
1. Create event in platform
2. Deploy collection contract (if new series)
3. Prepare badge metadata
4. Upload to TON Storage
5. Set minting permissions

#### Check-in Process
1. Attendee connects TON wallet
2. Organizer verifies physical presence
3. Initiate badge minting
4. Verify successful mint
5. Update attendance records

### Technical Implementation

### 1. Smart Contracts

#### Collection Contract
- Based on TEP-62 NFT standard
- Manages badge minting permissions
- Stores collection-wide metadata

```func
;; Collection contract methods
- get_collection_data()
- get_nft_address_by_index()
- get_nft_content()
- mint_badge()
```

#### Badge Contract
- Implements TEP-85 SBT standard
- Non-transferable
- Ownership proof mechanism

```func
;; Badge contract methods
- get_badge_data()
- prove_ownership()
- destroy() // Optional: Allow users to burn their badge
```
