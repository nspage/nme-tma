Creating digital badges on the TON (The Open Network) blockchain in the form of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) or SBTs (Soulbound Tokens) for event management involves several technical requirements. Here is a comprehensive list:

1. Blockchain Integration
TON Blockchain Compatibility: Ensure the system is compatible with the TON blockchain.
Smart Contracts: Develop and deploy smart contracts on the TON blockchain to manage the creation, distribution, and verification of digital badges.
2. Digital Badge Creation
NFT/SBT Standards: Implement NFT or SBT standards (e.g., @nft-standard and @sbt-standard) to create unique digital badges.
Metadata Storage: Store metadata for each badge, including event details, attendee information, and any additional attributes.
3. Verification of Attendance
Unique Identifiers: Assign unique identifiers to each digital badge to ensure authenticity.
Timestamping: Include timestamps to record the exact time of attendance.
Cryptographic Signatures: Use cryptographic signatures to prevent tampering and ensure the integrity of the attendance records.
4. Engagement and Rewards
Reward Mechanisms: Implement smart contract logic to distribute rewards based on the collection of digital badges.
Incentive Programs: Design incentive programs that offer exclusive access or benefits to attendees who collect a certain number of badges.
5. Community Building
Display and Trading: Develop a platform or integrate with existing marketplaces where attendees can display and trade their digital badges.
Social Features: Include social features such as sharing badges on social media or within the event community.
6. Data Collection
Attendance Tracking: Implement analytics to track attendance and engagement metrics.
Data Privacy: Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) when collecting and storing attendee data.
Reporting Tools: Provide reporting tools for event organizers to analyze attendance and engagement data.
7. Access Control
Digital Ticketing: Use digital badges as tickets to grant access to specific areas or activities within the event.
QR Code Integration: Integrate QR code scanning for quick and secure access verification.
Access Management: Implement access management systems to control entry based on the possession of digital badges.
8. Security
Secure Storage: Use secure storage solutions for digital badges and associated metadata.
Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data to protect attendee information.
Audit Trails: Maintain audit trails to track the creation, distribution, and verification of digital badges.
9. User Interface
User-Friendly Dashboard: Develop a user-friendly dashboard for attendees to manage their digital badges.
Mobile Compatibility: Ensure the system is compatible with mobile devices for easy access and verification.
Notifications: Implement notification systems to inform attendees about their digital badges and rewards.
